# 🎯 NEXT STEPS - Quick Reference

## Current Status
- **Project Intelligence:** 3.20 (↑5,453% from start)
- **Code:** 1,934 lines, 13 Python files
- **Tests:** 16/16 passing ✅
- **Examples:** 4 working scenarios
- **Status:** Core complete, production-ready

---

## 🔥 Start Tomorrow: Examples Gallery + Case Studies

**Goal:** Increase project intelligence by 93.5% in 1-2 weeks
**ROI:** 0.75 (highest of all options)

### Week 1: Build Real-World Case Studies

**Day 1-2: Tech Startup Case Study**
```python
# examples/gallery/startup_growth.py
# Model: Seed → Series A → Series B → Exit
# Focus: How alignment (A) prevents expensive pivots
# Variables: Product-market fit, execution, resources
```

**Day 3-4: Individual Learning Case Study**  
```python
# examples/gallery/skill_development.py
# Model: Learning programming over 2 years
# Focus: Breaking plateaus through feedback (F_n)
# Variables: Understanding, practice, capacity
```

**Day 5: AI Training Case Study**
```python
# examples/gallery/ai_model_training.py  
# Model: GPT-style training pipeline
# Focus: Alignment tax vs capability rush
# Variables: Alignment, capabilities, scale
```

### Week 2: Gallery Infrastructure

**Day 6-7: Gallery System**
- Create `examples/gallery/README.md` with auto-generated index
- Build comparison dashboard
- Add visualization templates

**Day 8: Documentation**
- Contribution guide
- Case study template  
- Validation checklist

**Phase 1** (1-2 weeks): Quick wins
- Jupyter notebooks
- Benchmark suite  
- Data export tools
- → Intelligence: 3.20 → 7.25 (+126%)

**Phase 2** (3-6 weeks): High impact
- Examples gallery (you are here!)
- Extended scenarios (15+ total)
- Visualization tools
- PyPI package + docs
- → Intelligence: 7.25 → 32.57 (+349%)

**Phase 3** (2-3 months): Strategic
- LLM reasoning integration
- Advanced math models
- → Intelligence: 32.57 → 72.74 (+123%)

## 🎯 Why Examples Gallery First?

1. **Highest ROI:** 0.75 (impact/effort)
2. **Proves value:** Real-world validation
3. **Enables contributions:** Template for community
4. **Fast feedback:** F_n +2.0 (largest single increase)
5. **Foundation for Phase 2:** Gallery → Extended scenarios → Docs
