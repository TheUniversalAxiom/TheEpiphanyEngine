# The EPIPHANY Engine ⚡️ Quantum AI

> An open-source implementation of **The Universal Axiom Organic Intelligence Model** (“The Axiom”) – a physics-style framework for modeling and evolving intelligence over time.

## What is this?

The EPIPHANY Engine treats intelligence as a dynamic process governed by a core equation:

\[
\text{Intelligence}_n = E_n \cdot (1 + F_n) \cdot X \cdot Y \cdot Z \cdot (A \cdot B \cdot C)
\]

This repo turns that conceptual model into:

- A **Python library** for modeling systems using A, B, C, X, Y, Z, Eₙ, Fₙ
- An **engine** for running time-based simulations (“TimeSphere”)
- Tools to **analyze corruption vs coherence** (subjectivity vs alignment)
- Examples and scenarios for humans, organizations, and AI models

## Features (planned)

- Core Axiom math (Eₙ, Fₙ, A·B·C, X, Y, Z)
- Scenario engine for defining and simulating systems over time
- Metrics for:
  - Subjective gravity vs objective alignment
  - Values → virtues formation over time
- Hooks for integrating with reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1-style flows)
- Jupyter notebooks for exploration and teaching

## Status

🚧 Early-stage / experimental. Expect breaking changes.

## Getting started

```bash
pip install -e .
