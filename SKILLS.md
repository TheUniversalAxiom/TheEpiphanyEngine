# Skills Framework (Universal Axiom)

This project defines skills using the **Universal Axiom Organic Intelligence Model**:

\[
\text{Intelligence}_n = E_n \cdot (1 + F_n) \cdot X \cdot Y \cdot Z \cdot (A \cdot B \cdot C)
\]

We treat each skill as a repeatable capability that improves by strengthening the
axiom components below.

## Skill Dimensions

| Dimension | Meaning | How it maps to skill growth |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **A (Impulses)** | Foundational motivations | Are the driving impulses aligned to the intended purpose? |
| **B (Elements)** | Core resources and capabilities | Are the essential elements present and usable? |
| **C (Pressure)** | Focus and refinement | Do constraints sharpen attention and decision-making? |
| **E_n (Exponential Growth)** | Dynamic scaling | Is momentum compounding over time? |
| **F_n (Fibonacci Sequence)** | Balanced growth | Is growth proportional and resilient? |
| **X (Axiomatic Subjectivity Scale)** | Objectivity vs. bias | How well is the skill grounded in truth and signal quality? |
| **Y (Why Axis)** | Purpose and goals | Does the output serve long-term intent? |
| **Z (TimeSphere)** | Temporal alignment | Is the skill applied in the right time context? |

## Using the Axiom to Build Skills

1. **Define the impulses (A).**
   - Clarify the motivations that the skill should serve.
2. **Inventory the elements (B).**
   - List the resources, tools, and behaviors required to execute well.
3. **Apply pressure (C).**
   - Add constraints that refine attention and eliminate noise.
4. **Build exponential growth (E_n).**
   - Establish routines that compound learning and delivery.
5. **Balance with Fibonacci feedback (F_n).**
   - Keep growth proportional by pacing iterations and recovery.
6. **Calibrate subjectivity (X).**
   - Use evidence, tests, and reviews to reduce bias.
7. **Align the why axis (Y).**
   - Connect outputs to the long-term purpose.
8. **Honor the timesphere (Z).**
   - Ensure the skill is applied in the right time horizon and context.

## Example Skill Card

**Skill:** TimeSphere Simulation Design

- **A (Impulses):** Driven by accurate modeling of intelligence evolution.
- **B (Elements):** Reproducible simulations, clear configs, and validated inputs.
- **C (Pressure):** Constraints on scope to keep scenarios focused and meaningful.
- **E_n (Exponential Growth):** Regular iteration on scenarios and update rules.
- **F_n (Fibonacci Sequence):** Balanced cadence between exploration and validation.
- **X (Axiomatic Subjectivity Scale):** Evidence-based assumptions and calibration.
- **Y (Why Axis):** Outputs tied to long-term insight and decision support.
- **Z (TimeSphere):** Scenarios aligned to the correct temporal horizon.

## Next Steps

- Add skill cards for engineering, research, and community domains.
- Track each skill’s dimension scores over time using the axiom.
